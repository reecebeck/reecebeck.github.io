Avid Engineer and tinkerer. Currently studying mechanical engineering at WPI

I refurbish and resell used silicon chip manufacturing equipment sourced from silicon valley on my <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/rebe1269">Ebay store</a>

Apart from these, I am a member of my school's club lacrosse team and the Alpha Tao Omega Fraternity.
