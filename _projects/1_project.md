Early summer 2025, I learned of a project, done under the company Cobaltix, to take the drive train and batteries from two Tesla Model 3s, and implement them into a completly custom off-road truck build. They had mad significant progress already with the body of the vehicle and retrofit of the front end, with the remaining pieces being installing, and more importantly getting all of the electronics to run properly. Upon hearing of their mission, I became excited and knew I could apply my own skills to the project. The usasge of CAN bus, technology involved with the BMS system, and tuning of the motor among other systems were all highly familar to me, and so I immadetly knew how to get started.

Intially, we had to program the VCU (Vehicle Control Unit), responsible for manageing every system in the car. During the first stages of the project, the original choice for the VCU was the AEM VCU 300, which is what we worked with here. It needed to be flashed with the appropriate firmware from a computer, through a wired CAN connection. 

To do this, we began work on the wiring harness for our bench test.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
